					<h2> Hi! Welcome to my portfolio. I am currently a third-year Informatics major with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction at the University of California, Irvine. </h2>
				</div>
				<p> I am an aspiring UI/UX designer and product manager. I love working alongside people and bridging the gap between business professionals and software professionals. I am passionate about leading teams and helping others understand the importance of technology in modern life. In my free time, I enjoy figure skating, finding new music to add to my extensive playlists, and anything beach related. I am an avid foodie and am always eager to try new restaurants in Orange County and the Bay Area. Feel free to connect with me if you are passionate about any of these subjects, I would love to talk to you!
